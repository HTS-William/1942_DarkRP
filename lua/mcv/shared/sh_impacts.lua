// Bullet impacts: the game's own per-surface systems in place of the engine's dust puff.
//
// particles/vietnam_impact_effects.pcf holds impact_<surface>_1 .. _3 for 33 surfaces. Each
// numbered system is a whole impact on its own, pulling in that surface's debris, mist, smoke,
// sparks and glow as children, so one of the three played at the hit point is the entire effect.
//
// The direction comes off the control points, not off the angles the system is created with.
// The children spray along the local X of a control point (Position Within Sphere Random with
// speed_in_local_coordinate_system: 180 of them read point 1 and 86 read point 0), so both
// points have to carry the surface normal as their forward, or every impact sprays the same
// way in world space whatever it hit. Only a clientside particle handle can set point 1, which
// is why this goes out as an effect (effects/mcv_impact.lua) rather than a plain ParticleEffect.
//
// SWEP:DoImpactEffect (mcv_base_core/shared.lua) hands the trace here and returns what this
// returns. Returning true takes the engine's UTIL_ImpactTrace off the shot, and that call is
// what puts the bullet hole down as well, so the hole is put back here by hand.
